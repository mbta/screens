# Triptych app packaging

## Resizing the PSAs

Outfront recommends these asset sizes:

- Images: The boards can take webp, which saves 35% or possibly more. OFM
  recommends using `sharp`, but you can also use
  [webp](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/webp). `cwebp -resize 1080 0 left.png -o left.webp` will resize left.png to the triptych screen size and convert to
  webp.
- Videos: Use handbrake video transcoder to reduce size to below 10MB, at least.
  (Perhaps much smaller.) To do so, get [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/), load
  the source file, and simply hit "Start". It compresses the file. Check the
  output to make sure it still looks good.

## Prepping the package

- Ensure [Corsica](https://hexdocs.pm/corsica/Corsica.html) is used on the
  server to allow CORS requests (ideally limited to just the triptych-relevant
  routes). It should already be configured at [this
  line](/lib/screens_web/controllers/v2/screen_api_controller.ex#L9) in the API
  controller--if it is, you don't need to do anything for this step.
- Double check that any behavior specific to the triptych screen environment
  happens inside of an `isTriptych()` or `isOFM()` check. This includes:

  - `buildApiPath` in use_api_response.tsx should return a full URL for the API
    path: prefix `apiPath` string with "https://screens.mbta.com".
  - `imagePath` in util.tsx should return relative paths (no leading `/`).

- Set the version string in assets/src/components/v2/triptych/version.tsx to
  `current_year.current_month.current_day.1`.
- If you've renamed / removed image assets, you might want to delete the
  corresponding folder in `/priv/static`. The folder accumulates assets without
  clearing old ones out, and these will be included in the built bundle!
- **Only if you are packaging for local testing**
  - add the following to the top of assets/src/apps/v2/triptych.tsx, filling in
    the string values:
    ```ts
    import { __TEST_setFakeMRAID__ } from "Util/outfront";
    __TEST_setFakeMRAID__({
      playerName: "<a player name from priv/triptych_player_to_screen_id.json>",
      station: "<a station name>",
      triptychPane: "<right | middle | left>",
    });
    ```
    This sets up a fake MRAID object that emulates the real one available to the
    client when running on Outfront screens. The MRAID object gives our client
    info about which screen it's running on.
  - replace the definition of `getOutfrontAbsolutePath` in
    assets/src/hooks/v2/use_api_response.tsx with `const getOutfrontAbsolutePath = () => isOFM() ? "http://localhost:4000" : "";`.
  - make sure priv/triptych_player_to_screen_id.json mirrors
    mbta-ctd-config/screens/triptych_player_to_screen_id-prod.json, or at least
    contains a mapping for the `playerName` that you hardcoded two steps ago.
- `cd` to priv/static and run the following:
  ```sh
  npm --prefix ../../assets run deploy && \
  cp -r css/packaged_triptych_v2.css js/packaged_triptych_polyfills.js js/packaged_triptych_v2.js js/packaged_triptych_v2.js.map ../triptych_preview.png ../triptych-app.html . && \
  cp -r js/triptych_images . && \
  cp ../triptych_template.json ./template.json && \
  zip -r triptych-app.zip packaged_triptych_v2.css packaged_triptych_polyfills.js packaged_triptych_v2.js packaged_triptych_v2.js.map fonts triptych_images triptych-app.html template.json triptych_preview.png
  ```
- On completion, the packaged client app will be saved at
  `priv/static/triptych-app.zip`.
- Commit the version bump on a branch, push it, and create a PR to mark the
  deploy.

## Working with Outfront

Once you've created the client app package, you'll need to send it to Outfront
for them to test and deploy it.

Ask a Screens team member for the email of our contact at Outfront. In your
message, be sure to specify:

- a player name (or "Liveboard name"), and
- a triptych pane (or `Array_configuration`--value should be of the form
  "Triple\_(Left|Middle|Right)")

## Debugging

To assist with debugging on the triptych screens, you can paste this at the
module scope in triptych.tsx to have console logs show up on the screen:

```js
const Counter = (() => {
  let n = 0;

  return {
    next() {
      let cur = n;
      n = (n + 1) % 100;
      return `${cur.toString().padStart(2, "0")}`;
    },
  };
})();

const dEl = document.createElement("div");
dEl.id = "debug";
dEl.className = "triptych";
document.body.appendChild(dEl);
// save the original console.log function
const old_logger = console.log;
// grab html element for adding console.log output
const html_logger = document.getElementById("debug");
// replace console.log function with our own function
console.log = function (...msgs) {
  // first call old logger for console output
  old_logger.call(this, arguments);

  // convert object args to strings and join them together
  const text = msgs
    .map((msg) => {
      if (typeof msg == "object") {
        return JSON && JSON.stringify ? JSON.stringify(msg) : msg;
      } else {
        return msg;
      }
    })
    .join(" ");

  // add the log to the html element.
  html_logger.innerHTML = `<div class="line">${Counter.next()} ${text} </div>${
    html_logger.innerHTML
  }`;
};

console.log("On-screen logger initialized");
```
