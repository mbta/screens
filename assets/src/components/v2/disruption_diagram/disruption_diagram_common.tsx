/*
Client is responsible for:

- formatting label strings appropriately
  - Wrapping end labels onto a second line in certain cases (can this condition be determined automatically? Or do we need to hardcode the line-wrapping treatments?)
  - Abbreviating middle labels when necessary
  - Giving "to" and "&" a smaller type size, medium weight in destination labels
  - Using larger, bold font for left and right end labels
  - Using bold font for "you-are-here" station labels
- all positioning and sizing of:
  - destination arrows
  - stop symbols
    - the "closed" icon is smaller in suspensions than in station closures
  - line segments
  - shuttle bus dashes
  - labels
    - The horizontally-oriented '...' label occasionally used for a sequence of omitted stops gets offset to the right a bit
  - the diagram as a whole within its container
- icon variations
  - larger white margin around red "closed" icon for a bypassed you-are-here stop on the red line
  - larger icons for terminals

Q: Do we need to hardcode the typesetting for all end labels, or is there some procedure to determine them automatically?
     - It seems like we do need to hardcode at least some of them, so I made the data structure reflect that by assigning each one an ID
       which the client will use to look up how to render it.
Q: The rule for abbreviating middle-node labels** does not appear to be applied consistently in the figma examples. Is it correct?
   ** Abbreviate when label.height > 8 + max(l_end.label.height, r_end.label.height)
Q: What's the treatment for when the you-are-here stop is in the middle of a shuttle or suspension?
