# Triptych React app testing

See [the triptych README](../assets/src/components/v2/triptych/README.md) for
packaging instructions. This doc also includes instructions for adding an
on-screen console logger, helpful for seeing what's going on when the package is
running on a real triptych.

Babel config lives in [assets/webpack.config.js](../assets/webpack.config.js).

I have 2 old PRs that may be of use for this work:

- [#1877 - WIP: Triptych package fixes/improvements, sans error
  boundary](https://github.com/mbta/screens/pull/1877).\
  This should be the most recent version of the React app. Older commits in the
  PR include the error boundary.
- [#1881 - No-framework plain JS triptych
  app](https://github.com/mbta/screens/pull/1883).\
  This should be the most recent version of the plain-JS app.
