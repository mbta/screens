# Summary

[summary]: #summary

Our DUP app requires a unique approach to alerts and how they are displayed. DUPs contain one screen with three different pages (rotations). When an alert affecting the stops serving the DUP is active, each page displays the alert in a different way depending on how impactful the alert is to the screen.

# Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

Converting the DUP app from v1 to v2 requires a different approach to alerts and how they are displayed on the screen.

# Guide-level explanation

[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

The DUP alerts widget needs to resolve a scenario specific to DUP screens: the screen "rotates" between three separate pages. When an applicable[^1] alert exists, each rotation has specific logic that determines which "type" of alert widget to display: `partial`[^2] or `takeover`[^3].

## Config

A new config key, `alerts`, will be used to provide us with the `route_ids` and `stop_ids` needed in the API query.

## CandidateGenerator

`CandidateGenerator.Dup` is responsible for deciding what alert should appear on a screen. It fetches all active alerts using the `route_ids` and `stop_ids` listed in the `alerts` config, filters out all alerts that do not directly affect the current stop (no downstream alerts), and selects the alert with the highest priority[^4]. If an alert meets all criteria, the `CandidateGenerator` will then create three `WidgetInstance`s for the alert (one for each rotation).

## WidgetInstance

The DUP alert `WidgetInstance` is responsible for choosing alert type and serializing the alert data for the frontend to consume. The alert type will be chosen based on rotation and how impactful the alert is.

# Reference-level explanation

[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

## Config

DUPs will get a new config key, `alerts`, that will provide us with the values needed to fetch the correct alerts. It will have the following shape:

```
%{
  route_ids: list(String.t()),
  stop_ids: list(String.t())
}
```

## CandidateGenerator

`CandidateGenerator.Dup` is responsible for fetching relevant alerts from the API. The API query will have the following `opts` array:

```
opts = [
      stop_ids: <stop_ids from alerts config>,
      route_ids: <route_ids from alerts config>,
      route_types: ~w[light_rail subway]a
    ]
```

A single alerts fetch will be made to retrieve all alerts. After the fetch, we will apply a filter to eliminate alerts we do not want on screens: `Enum.filter(&relevant?/1)`. `relevant?/1` will return `true` if an alert is active and applicable[^1]. Unless we need special logic for the screen (Kenmore has a file of special logic [here](/lib/screens/dup_screen_data/special_cases.ex)), we choose the alert to display based on a priority[^4]. The pipeline for this step will be the following:

```
alert =
    opts
    |> Alert.fetch()
    |> Enum.filter(&relevant?/1)
    |> choose_alert()
```

With this alert, we create three `WidgetInstance` objects for each rotation:

```
[
  %DupAlert{screen: config, rotation_index: :zero, alert: alert},
  %DupAlert{screen: config, rotation_index: :one, alert: alert},
  %DupAlert{screen: config, rotation_index: :two, alert: alert}
]
```

## WidgetInstance

In `WidgetInstance.DupAlert`, the following type will be used for the struct:

```
@type t :: %__MODULE__{
          screen: Screen.t(),
          alert: Alert.t(),
          rotation_index: :zero | :one | :two
        }
```

Because irrelevant alerts are filtered out in the `CandidateGenerator`, we are able to always return `true` from `valid_candidate?/1`.

A function `get_region_and_headsign(alert, parent_stop_id)` will be created based on the logic from [this function](/lib/screens/dup_screen_data/data.ex#L11). This function will be used by `serialize/1` to determine an alert's region and headsign. If `region == :inside`, `headsign` is `nil`. If `region == :boundary`, `headsign` is populated using [this map](/config/config.exs#L86).

`slot_names/1` will need to use different logic for each rotation. See spec for details.

Two serialize functions will be created: `serialize_partial_alert/1` and `serialize_takeover_alert/1`.

`serialize_partial_alert/1` returns the following map:

```
%{
    alert_text: %FreeTextLine{icon: :warning, text: ...},
    color: :red | :orange | :green | :blue
}
```

`alert_text.text` is either `No ${headsign} trains` or `No ${line} service` depending on the value of `headsign` in the return of `get_region_and_headsign/2`.

`serialize_takeover_alert/1` returns the following map:

```
%{
    alert_text: %FreeTextLine{icon: :warning, text: ...},
    color: :red | :orange | :green | :blue,
    remedy: %FreeTextLine{icon: :shuttle | nil, text: ...},
    header: %{
        icon: :logo,
        text: String.t(),
        pattern: :hatched | :x | :chevron,
        color: :red | :orange | :green | :blue
    }
}
```

The value of `alert_text` is the same as for `serialize_partial_alert/1`. `remedy.icon` is `:shuttle` if `alert.effect == :shuttle` and `nil` otherwise. `remedy.text` uses the following mapping:

```
@alert_remedy_text_mapping %{
    delay: "Expect delays",
    shuttle: "Use shuttle bus",
    suspension: "Seek alternate route",
    station_closure: "Seek alternate route"
}
```

`header.text` is the stop name for the screen. `header.time` is the current time. `header.pattern` is based on `alert.effect`: `:station_closure -> :x`, `:suspension -> :chevron`, all others are `:hatched`. `header.color` is the route color.

# Considered Alternatives

## Two separate widgets

For this approach, there would be two separate `WidgetInstance`s: one for `partial`, one for `takeover`. The `CandidateGenerator` would use similar logic to what is laid out above. The key difference is instead `WidgetInstance` making the decision on alert type, the `CandidateGenerator` would hold that logic and create a `WidgetInstance` object based on the result.

### Reason for rejection

This approach would require giving the `CandidateGenerator` business logic needed to determine type. This pushes back on some framework fundamentals that are laid out in our [architecture doc](/docs/architecture/widget_framework.md). It is best that we give the `CandidateGenerator` the responsibility of fetching data needed for our widgets and not have it make decisions on how a widget should work.

[^1]: An applicable alert is an alert with an effect of `delay` with `severity` >= 5, `shuttle`, `suspension`, or `station_closure` that affects the `route_ids` and `stop_ids` from the `alerts` section of the DUP config.
[^2]: A `partial` alert takes up only a small amount of the screen to allow for other departures to remain visible.
[^3]: A `takeover` alert displays over the whole screen including the departures.
[^4]: Priority for DUP alerts is pick a shuttle alert if present. Otherwise, pick the first in the list.
