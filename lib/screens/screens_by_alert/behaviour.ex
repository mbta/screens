  @moduledoc """
  Behavior for accessing the cache that holds screens by alert.

  - `start_link(opts)` is called to start the backend by the supervisor.
  - `put_data(screen_id, list(alert_id))` inserts the list of alert_ids visible on a given screen_id
    to the cache.
  - `get_screens_by_alert(alert_ids)` returns a map associating each requested alert_id with the screen IDs that are currently displaying it.
  - `get_screens_last_updated(screen_ids)` returns a map associating each requested screen_id with its last-updated Unix timestamp.
