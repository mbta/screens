      Creating representations of "now" within a function's body
      via `DateTime.utc_now/0` and similar functions causes the
      function to be untestable. It's not possible to control the
      "now" value from unit tests, so their outcomes can vary depending
      on when they are run--that is, they become "flaky".

      Instead, the "now" value should be taken as an argument with
      a default value. (Or no default value if it's a private function)
      In normal circumstances, the default value
      will be used, but unit tests can pass their own fixed "now" value
      so that they have full control over the test's outcome.

      Untestable:

          def after_noon_utc?, do: DateTime.utc_now().hour >= 12

      Testable:

          def after_noon_utc?(now \\ DateTime.utc_now()), do: now.hour >= 12

      Using the testable function in production code:

          if after_noon_utc?(), do: "Good afternoon", else: "Good morning"

      Testing the testable function:

          morning = ~U[2022-01-01T09:00:00Z]
          afternoon = ~U[2022-01-01T15:00:00Z]

          refute after_noon_utc?(morning)
          assert after_noon_utc?(afternoon)
