defmodule Screens.V2.DisruptionDiagram.Model do
  @moduledoc """
  Functions to generate a disruption diagram from a `LocalizedAlert`.

  Most of the logic is focused on fitting content into at most 14 slots by omitting stops from the Closure, the Gap, and/or the
  Ends as necessary.

  The logic reflects the flowchart created by Betsy and viewable [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVP2Hgi18=/).

  # ðŸ“• Terminology

  | Term | Definition |
  | :- | :- |
  | Slot | A single, labeled "point" on the diagram. Can be a stop, an omitted segment, a terminal stop, or a destination arrow. Slots do not necessarily correspond 1:1 with stops. |
  | Region | A group of slots forming one part of the diagram. Regions can overlap or subsume one another, with a consistent order of precedence: Closure > Gap > Current Location > Ends. |
  | Closure | The region containing disrupted stops. For station closures, the non-disrupted stops on either end of the disrupted area are also included. |
  | Current Location | The region containing this screen's home stop, as well as the stop(s) on either side of it. |
  | Gap | The region between the Closure and the screen's home stop. When present, the Gap always takes the Current Location stop closest to the Closure. |
  | Ends | The up-to 2 slots at either end of the diagram. These can take the form of either terminal stops, or destination arrows. |
