  Returns the widget's priority. A priority is encoded as a nonempty list of non-negative integers. For example:

  ```
  [1]

  [0]

  [1, 1, 2]
  ```

  The main purpose of priority values is to act as a sort key for each widget. We take advantage
  of Elixir's default term ordering for lists, which compares each element in order until a non-equal pair is found.

  ```
  true = [0] < [1]

  false = [2] < [1]

  # The first non-equal pair decides the result. In this case, 2 < 25.
  true = [1, 2, 99] < [1, 25, 0]

  true = [2, 0] < [3]

  # when one list ends without a tiebreaker, the shorter list wins
  true = [1, 2] < [1, 2, 0]
  ```

  This allows priority values to be as rough-or-fine-grained as we need them to be.

  The highest possible priority is `[0]`.
