# Screens

This application serves real-time information to all of our browser-based screens posted at stops and stations around the system.

If you're looking for the applications that control the LED countdown clocks and the in-station PA system, please see [mbta/realtime_signs](https://github.com/mbta/realtime_signs) and [mbta/signs_ui](https://github.com/mbta/signs_ui).

Some examples of the various client apps, as of January 2023:

| screen type (click for a sample screenshot) | description                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Bus E-Ink][bus_eink sample]                | solar-powered E-Ink screens at bus stops                                                                                      |
| [Green Line E-Ink][gl_eink sample]          | solar-powered E-Ink screens at surface-level Green Line stops                                                                 |
| [Bus corridor LCD][bus_shelter sample]      | currently used at stops on the Columbus Ave bus corridor                                                                      |
| [Multimodal LCD][solari sample]             | used at high-traffic transfer stations served by many routes/modes                                                            |
| [Pre-fare duo LCD][pre_fare sample]         | posted outside of fare gates at rapid transit stations; content is split across two portrait-oriented 1080p physical displays |
| ["Digital Urban Panel" LCD][dup sample]     | content appears in rotation with ads on screens posted outside rapid transit station entrances                                |

## Getting Started

You have two options to set up the project environment for development:

1. [Run on your local machine, with dependencies installed locally.](docs/local_development.md)
   - Pros: Runs fast; use the code editor of your choice
   - Cons: Requires building Erlang from source; makes version upgrades more difficult
1. :new::sparkles: [Run inside a Docker container using VS Code's Devcontainer extension.](docs/devcontainer_development.md)
   - Pros: Simple, one-click build process; easy version upgrades; integrated-ish development environment; host-OS-agnostic
   - Cons: Restricted to VS Code as an editor; file read/write is a bit slower

## Architecture

On <sup>almost</sup> all of our screen types, we use a common "framework" to fetch relevant real-time info for the screen's location, and then determine which pieces of info are most important to riders from moment to moment.

Check out [ARCHITECTURE.md](/ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of the application architecture, as well as links to further more detailed documentation.

## Packaging the DUP app

The DUP screens require the client app to be packaged into a single HTML file rather than dynamically served from our Phoenix server.

You can find instructions on the packaging process [here](assets/src/components/v2/dup/README.md).

## Version upgrade guide

You can find some hopefully useful notes on upgrading the project's Elixir version, and possibly other upgrades, [here](docs/version_upgrade.md).
